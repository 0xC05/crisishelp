"So thank you firstly for @\ZoomerX for this suggestion. We've created a @Crisis Help role for those who want to chat about any issues they are having, whether this be personal, mental health etc. Staff/Mods and community members who want to help will be given this role. Once you ping this you'll be allocated the @safezone role and will have access to the #safe-zone channel where you talk things through with people are there to help. We all have bad days/weeks/months hey even years, but a problem shared from people who have been where you are (myself included), can really make the difference. Ultimately we're all in this together, so its the least we can do. @everyone ❤️" ~ Stu, Owner of TMHC

This repo is aimed to store JSON files which have info about popular and helpful websites of Suicide Prevention Helplines. The JSON files will be parsed by my bot when the command !crisishelp is called, and be sent as a message to the server.

Mental health is important, it's no joke. Whenever you have any problems, please talk to someone. We are here for you.

Please help me contribute to this project by adding more countries, so this bot can help everyone around the world.
